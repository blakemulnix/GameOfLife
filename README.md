# GameOfLife - Conway's Game of Life Web Application

## Description

Welcome to the **GameOfLife** project! This is an ongoing endeavor aimed at creating an interactive website that allows users to engage with Conway's Game of Life. This project not only serves as a playground for exploring cellular automata but also as a platform for me to acquire proficiency in various cutting-edge technologies. By combining tools like AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, React, GraphQL, and more, I will be advancing my software engineering skills.

## Key Features

Some features I have planned are:

- **Userbase Management**
  - Secure user authentication
  - Personalized user profiles
- **Engaging Gameplay**
  - Play the Game of Life without an account
  - Log in to create, save, and share unique "organisms"

## Technologies in Action

To bring this project to life, I'm harnessing the power of multiple technologies:

- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure** - Hosting the application with scalability in mind
- **Bash Scripting** - Leveraging automation for various tasks
- **Terraform Orchestration** - Provisioning and configuring infrastructure efficiently
- **React for Dynamic UI** - Crafting an engaging and responsive frontend experience
- **Cognito Authentication** - Implementing robust user authentication mechanisms
- **GraphQL Communication** - Enabling seamless communication between the client and server
- **DynamoDB Data Storage** - Storing and managing game states and user profiles

## Work in Progress

Please note that this project is still a work in progress. I'm continually refining the codebase and expanding its features.
